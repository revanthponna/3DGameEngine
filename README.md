# 3D Game Engine

- This project is where I refactored an existing 3D Game Engine codebase, improved the Graphics System maintenance, and extended the engine's functionality with new features.

## Notable Work
  
  1. Created a platform-independent interface for the Graphics System, with platform-specific representation of meshes, effects, and shaders for both Direct3D and OpenGL.
  2. Implemented Reference Counting to keep track of Graphics data in a multi-threaded environment.
  3. Created a human-readable mesh file format using Lua, then read and output the geometry data in binary to improve performance.
  4. Built a Maya plug-in to seamlessly export meshes and geometry from Maya directly into the game engine.
  5. Implemented my own Networking System using the UDP Client-Server model, that supports real-time communication between multiple clients of a game.
  6. Put together a final multiplayer space-shooting game to showcase all the various engine systems I worked on.
